# Security

A list of things that absolutely most be done before we publish this in any production level environment.

TODO
[] Move all confidential configuration into .env files
[] Better logging and error logging (hint: morgan)
    [] Properly handle errors by making sure they don't break the app
[] Figure out how to properly deal with CORs issues

Lower priority
[] Get a monitoring solution in case app/server breaks
[] More strict TypeScript
